# Automation

## What is an Automation?

"**Automation**" is a feature which can automate task for AndroidAPS.

Automations performs specific actions based on one or more conditions or triggers. Triggers can include irregular events like low or high blood glucose (BG) levels, or a set amount of negative insulin on board (IOB). Automations can also handle recurring events, such as meals or exercise at certain times of day, or when the user is within a specific distance of a GPS location or a WIFI SSID area. Automation can execute AAPS settings backups based on a schedule or on every Pod change.

Automations rules are created and modified from the Automations tab. Each rule is defined by two properties:

- One or more conditions or 'triggers' that start an action.

    Think of a certain time schedule, an event or propertie value in AAPS

- One or more actions to perform.

    Such as an alarm or settings a profile percentage or exporting the AAPS settings on Pod change.


There are a wide range of Automation options, and users are encouraged to study these within the AAPS app, in the Automation section. You can also search the AAPS user groups on **Facebook** and **Discord** for Automation examples from other users. 

## How Automation can help

1. **Decreasing decision fatigue:** The primary benefit of **Automations** is to relieve the user from the burden of having to make manual interventions in **AAPS**. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6286423/#ref4) estimates that an average of 180 additional daily decisions have to be made by those living with Type 1 diabetes. **Automations** can lessen the mental load, freeing up the user’s mental energy for other aspects of life.

1. **Potentially improving glycemic control:** for example, **Automations** can help ensure **Temp Targets** are always set when needed, even during busy schedules or periods of forgetfulness. For example, if a child with diabetes has sports scheduled at school on Tuesdays at 10am and Thursdays at 2pm and requires a high Temp Target ('TT') actioned 30 minutes before the sports activity, the **Temp Target** can be enabled by way of an **Automation**. 

1. **Enabling AAPS to be highly customised** to be more or less aggressive in specific situations, according to a user's preference. For example, triggering a temporary reduced **Profile** % for a set period of time if negative **IOB** develops in the middle of the night, indicating that the existing **Profile** may be too strong. 

The example below illustrates how an **Automation** can enable steps to be eliminated.

User exercises every morning at 6 am: he needs to remember to manually set a "Temp Target-Activity" in AAPS at 5am, before exercising.

The user has set an **Automation** to trigger a 5am ‘Temp Target-Activity’ to ensure their **BG** and **IOB** are optimal, in preparation for their 6 am exercise:

## Key considerations before starting with Automations

1. Before setting up certain Automations, you should have reasonable **BG** control with **AAPS**. Automations should not be used to compensate for sub-optimal basal, **ISF** or **CR** settings (discussed further below). Avoid setting an automated **Profile switch** to compensate for **BG** rises due to _e.g._ food, these are better dealt with via other strategies (SMBs etc). 

1. As with any technology, **CGMs**, **Pumps** and phones can malfunction: Technical issues or sensor errors can disrupt the **Automation** actions, and manual intervention may be needed. 

1. **Requirements for **Automations** are likely to change as routines change**. When changing between work/school/holiday periods, set a reminder in your calendar to review which **Automations** are currently active (they are easy to activate and de-activate). For example, if you go on holiday, and no longer need a Automation set up for school sports or daily exercise, or need to adjust the timings.

1. **Automations** may conflict with each other, and it is good to review any new **Automation(s)** setting carefully in a safe environment, and understand why an **Automation** may or may not have triggered in the way you expect. 

1. If using Autosens, try to use **Temp Targets** instead of **Profile Switches**. **Temp Targets** do not reset Autosens back to 0. **Profile Switches** reset Autosens. 

1. Most **Automations** should only be set for a **limited time duration**, after which **AAPS** can re-evaluate and repeat the **Automation**, if necessary, and if the condition is still met. For example, "start temp target of 7.0 mmol/l for 30 min" or "start **Profile** 110% for 10 min" _and_ "start temp target of 5.0 mmol/l for 10 min". Using **Automations** to create permanent changes (e.g. to stronger %profile) risks hypoglycemia.  

## When can I start using Automation?

**Automations** can be started in **objective 10**. 

## Where are Automations located in AAPS?

Depending on your [Config builder > General](../SettingUpAaps/ConfigBuilder.md) settings, **Automation** is located either in the ‘hamburger’ menu or as a tab with **AAPS**.

## How can I set up an Automation?

To set up an **Automation** create a ‘rule’ with **AAPS** as follows:

![Automation create](../images/automation_create.png)

* give your ‘rule’ a title;
* select at least one ‘Condition’;

![Automation condition](../images/automation_condition.png)

* select one ‘Action’;

![Automation action](../images/automation_action.png)

* check the right box to the **Automation** event is ‘ticked’ to activate the **Automation**:

![Automation](../images/automation_2024-10-26_17-48-05.png)



To deactivate an **Automation** rule, untick the box left of the name of the **Automation**. The example below shows an **Automation** entitled ‘Low Glucose TT’ as either activated (‘ticked') or deactivated (‘unticked’).

![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_20-56-08.png)


When setting up an **Automation**, you can first test it by activating the ‘notification’ option under "Actions". This triggers **AAPS** to first display a notification rather than actually automating an action. When you are comfortable that the notification has been triggered at the correct time/conditions, the **Automation** rule can be updated to replace the ‘Notification’ with an ‘Action’.

```{admonition} Important note
:class: note

**Automations** are still active when the Loop is disabled!
```


## Safety limits

There are safety limits set for **Automations**:

* The **glucose** value has to be between 72 and 270 mg/dl (or 4 and 15 mmol/l).
* The **Profile Percentage** has to be between 70% and 130%.
* There is a 5 minute time limit between executions of  **Automation** (and first execution).

## Correct use of negative values

```{admonition} Warning
:class: warning

Please be careful when selecting a negative value in **Automation**
```

Caution must be taken when selecting a ‘negative value’ within the ‘Condition’ like "less than" in **Automations**. For example:

![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_20-56-25.png-500x.png)

**Example 1:** Creating a Condition **"is lesser than"** "-0.1mmol/l" (or "-2mg/dl") will:

Trigger an **Automation** for any number which is **strictly less than** -0.1 (-2). This includes numbers like -0.2, -0.3, -0.4 (-4, -6, -8) and so on. Remember that -0.1 (-2) itself **is not** included in this condition. (The condition "is equal or lesser than -0.1mmol/l (-2 mg/dl)" _would_ include -0.1 mmol/l or -2 mg/dl). 

**Example 2:** Creating a Condition "is greater than" -0.1mmol/l (-2mg/dl) will:

Trigger an **Automation** for any number which is **greater than** -0.1mmol/l (-2mg/dl). This includes numbers like 0, 0.2, 0.4mmol/l, (0, 4, 8mg/dl) and any other positive number.

It is important to carefully consider the exact intention of your **Automation** when choosing these conditions and values.

## Automation Triggers

![Automation Triggers](../images/automation_triggers.png)

There are various ‘Triggers’ that can be selected by the user. Triggers are the conditions that must be met in order for the automation to execute. The list below is non-exhaustive:

**Trigger:** connect conditions

**Options:** 

Several conditions can be linked with
* “And”
* “Or”
* “Exclusive or” (which means that if one - and only one of the - conditions applies, the action(s) will happen)

**Trigger:** time vs. recurring time

**Options:** 

* time = single time event
* recurring time = something that happens regularly (i.e. once a week, every working day etc.)

**Trigger:** location

**Options:**

* in the **config builder** (Automation), the user can select their required location service.

**Trigger:** location service

**Options:**

* Use passive location: **AAPS** only takes locations when other apps are requesting it.
* Use network location: Location of your Wi-Fi.
* Use GPS location (Attention! This can cause excessive battery drain!)

**Triggers** : pump and sensor data

* Cannula age trigger: Available for all pumps
* Insulin age trigger: Available for supported pumps
* Battery age trigger: Available for supported pumps
* Sensor age trigger: always available
* Pod Activation trigger: Available for patch pumps

Note that for all age related triggers the equal comparison is unlikely to trigger, so in that case two triggers are required to create a range

* Reservoir level trigger: Available for all pumps, comparison "NOT\_AVAILABLE" is not working for this trigger as the value is always filled in **AAPS**
* Pump battery level trigger: Available for supported pumps, comparison "NOT\_AVAILABLE" is not working for this trigger as the value is always filled in **AAPS**

## Action

![Automation Triggers](../images/automation_actions.png)

**Actions:** start **Temp Target**

**Options:** 

* **BG** must be between 72 mg/dl and 270 mg/dl (4 mmol/l and 15 mmol/l)
* **TT** works only if there is no previous Temp Target

**Actions:** stop **Temp Target**

**Options:**

none

**Actions:** **Profile Percentage**

**Options:**

* **Profile** must be between 70% and 130%
* works only if the previous Percentage is 100%

Once the ‘Action’ is added,  the default values must be changed to the desired number by clicking and adjusting the default values.

(Automations-the-order-of-the-automations-in-the-list-matters)=
## The order of the **Automations** in the list matters 
 **AAPS** will automate the rules created in the order of preference, starting from the top of the **Automation** list. For example, if the ‘Low’  **Automation** is the most important **Automation**, above all other rules, then this  **Automation** should appear at the top of the user’s **Automation** list as demonstrated below:


![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_20-57-48.png-500x.png)

To reprioritize the **Automation** rules, click and hold the four-lines-button on the right side of the screen. Reorder the  **Automations** by moving the rules up or down.

![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_20-58-00.png-500x.png)

## How to delete Automation rules

To delete an **Automation** rule click on the trash icon.

## Examples of Automations

Below are examples of **Automations**. Further discussion on **Automations** and how users have individualised their  **Automation** can be found in Facebook discussions groups or on Discord. The examples below should not be replicated without the user having a good understanding of how the **Automation** will work.

### Low Glucose Temp Target

This **Automation**  triggers an automatic ‘Temp Target Hypo’ when low **BG** is at a certain threshold. 

![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_21-04-01.png-500x.png)

### Lunch Time Temp Target (with ‘Location’)

![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_21-04-25.png-500x.png)

This **Automation** has been created for a user who eats their lunch at work around the same time every weekday but triggered only if the user is situated within a set ‘location’.  So if the user is not at work one day, this **Automation** will be activated.

This **Automation** will set a low **Temp Target** (Eating Soon) at 13:00 to drive ‘BG, to 90mg (or 5 mmol/l) in preparation for lunch. 

The ‘Trigger’ location is set by inputting the latitude and longitude GPS coordinates as below:

![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_21-04-40.png-500x.png)

Because of the ‘And’ connection, the **Automation** only happens during the ‘chosen time’ and if the user is at the selected location. 

The **Automation** will not be triggered on any other time at this location or on this time outside of 50 meters set GPS coordinates.

### WIFI SSID Location Automation

Using WIFI SSID is a good option to trigger an **Automation** while within range of a specific wifi network (than compared with GPS), it is fairly precise, uses less battery and works in enclosed spaces where GPS and other location services might not be available.   

Here is another example of setting up a **Temp Target** for work days only before breakfast(1). 


The **Automation** will trigger at 05:30am only on Monday-Friday(2)  
and while being connected to a home wifi network (3).


It will then set a **Temp Target**  of 75mg/dl for 30 minutes (4). 
One of the advantages of including the location is that it will not trigger if the user is travelling on vacation for instance. 

![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_21-05-02.png-500x.png)

Here is the screenshot detailing the **Automation** triggers:

1) Under the main “AND” (both conditions need to be met to trigger)
1) Recurring time = M,T,W,T,F At 5:30am  
1) WIFI SSID = My_Home_WiFi_Name

![Alt text](../images/automation_2024-02-12_21-05-16.png-500x.png)

## Automation Logs

**AAPS** has a log of the most recent **Automation** triggered at the bottom of the screen under the **Automation** tab. 

In the example below the logs indicate:

(1) at 01:58 am, the “Low BG triggers temp hypo profile” is activated 
* glucose value is less than 75mg/dl;
* delta is negative (ie: the BG is going down);
* time is within 01:00 am and 06:00 am.

The **Automation** will:
* set a **Temp Target** to 110mg/dl for 40 minutes;
* start a temporary **Profile** at 50% for 40 minutes.

(2) at 03:38 am,  the “High carb after low at night” is triggered
* time is between 01:05 am and 06:00 am;
* glucose value is greater than 110mg/dl.

The **Automation** will:
* change **Profile** to LocalProfile1 (ie: cancel the temporary profile if any)
* stop **Temp Target** (if any)

## Alternatives to Automations

For advanced users, there are other possibilities to automate tasks using IFTTT or a third party Android app called Automate.
